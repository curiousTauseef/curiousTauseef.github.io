# curiousTauseef.github.io
static website created during my stay in Leuven using the material from http://thejackalofjavascript.com/your-portfolio-website-with-github-pages/

I visited the website above and decided to make a static website for our proposed startup.
I followed the steps mentioned, thereby creating a new repository - curiousTauseef.github.io, with same name as my GitHub user name.
Next, I created a directory called /home/tauseef/git-repo/gitHubIOPage/myGitHubSite in my Ubuntu desktop, followed by cloning the above repository
repo inside the directory- myGitHubSite. I downloaded the Jedy website theme from BootStrap website, unzipped it, copied the contents to
/home/tauseef/git-repo/gitHubIOPage/myGitHubSite/curiousTauseef.github.io. I made suitable changes to index.html file. 
Finally I used the git commands - add, commit and push origin master to push the changes to the GitHub.

To understand the command of Git I referred the textbook called Pro Git written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.
